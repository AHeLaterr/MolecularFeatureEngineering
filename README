# MolecularFeatureEngineering

Machine learning-based identification of separating features in molecular fragments.

Development is almost complete, finishing final testing, documentation, and publication now. 

This set of libraries aims to aid researchers in “Virtual Screening”, a new application of software engineering used in the pharmaceutical industry to quickly identify potential active molecules with respect to a given macromolecular target. The project’s goal is to understand what physio-chemical features of topological fragments in candidate molecules make them react to certain target molecules, and then create a software system that can dynamically learn and utilize this information with new target molecules.

Dependencies: NumPy,scikitlearn.
